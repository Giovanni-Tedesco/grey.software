        <p class="g-section-body mt-4 pl-4">"As our society grows more dependent on computers, 
            the software we run is of critical importance to securing the future of a free society."
        </p>

        <p class="g-section-body mt-4 pl-4">With our lives increasingly governed by software written by corporations 
        that monetize our data, it is more important than ever to protect our freedom to 
        know what the software programs we run are doing.
        </p>

        <p class="g-section-body mt-4 pl-4">Grey Software creates open source software that anyone 
        else can study and improve by looking into the source code. It holds us as an organization 
        accountable for being ethical with the trust our users put in us.
        </p>

        <p class="g-section-body mt-4 pl-4">By donating, you help keep alive the dream of a future where humans 
        use open source software that protects their freedoms.

            To Revolutionize Software Education
      </h1>
      <div class="row mt-5">
        
        <p class="g-section-body mt-4 pl-4">The software education ecosystem weâ€™re building encourages new, enthusiastic 
        software developers to apprentice under maintainers on open source projects. This allows students to gain valuable experience 
        while maintainers get enthusiastic developers and a source of income. We believe that a collaborative, education-driven environment 
        such as this can advance software technology in a positive direction. By donating, you help fund the technical infrastructure needed 
        to run our education programs, and provide the possibility of financial aid to students.
