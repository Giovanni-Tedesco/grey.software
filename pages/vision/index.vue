        We aim to revolutionize the way students learn software engineering by empowering students to build useful 
        and creative apps for human welfare with a mentor in an open-source environment. Students can join as an apprentice or an explorer.
        </p>

      

        <p class="g-section-body mt-4 pl-4">
        Apprentices want to get better at software engineering by contributing to useful 
        software in a professional, open-source environment.
        </p>

        <p class="g-section-body mt-4 pl-4">
        Grey Software maintains several open-source apps that apprentices can contribute to. 
        Contributing to apps that are relevant in the real world, students can learn how the apps they interact with are built, 
        deployed, and maintained.

            Explorers have an idea and would like to build a software prototype with a mentor 
            that can guide them using best practices from the open-source software community.

            <p class="g-section-body mt-4 pl-4">
            With their mentorâ€™s guidance, explorers can scope their idea down into a viable 
            software prototype and establish a remote, agile and async development environment 
            with the help of tools such as Discord, VS Code, and Github.
